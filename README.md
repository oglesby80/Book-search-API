üìö Google Books API Search Engine
This project refactors a fully functional Google Books API search engine that was previously built using a RESTful API. It now utilizes GraphQL with Apollo Server to enhance the API capabilities. The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and allows users to search for books, save books to their accounts, and manage saved books.
